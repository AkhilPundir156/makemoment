## âš¡ Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkhilPundir156/makemoment.git

Install dependencies in each folder as needed.

Follow individual README.md in dashboard/, backend/, cli/, or extension/ to run or deploy.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Backend handles auth, presigned uploads, and DB logging.

CLI and Extension upload directly to S3; backend only orchestrates requests.

Each subfolder is deployable separately.
